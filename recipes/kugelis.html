    <h2>Traditional Lithuanian Potato Pudding (Kugelis) Recipe</h2>
    <p>This traditional recipe for Lithuanian savory potato pudding, known as <em>kugelis</em> or <em>bulviu plokstainis</em> (literally "flat potato"), produces a dense, heavy casserole that is considered a national dish of Lithuania.</p>
    <p>Kugelis is commonly served with applesauce, lingonberry preserves, sour cream, or crumbled bacon bits and can be eaten as a main course or side dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>1/2 pound bacon, chopped</li>
     <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
     <li>5 large eggs, beaten</li>
     <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
     <li>1 (7-ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
     <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
     <li>1/2 cup farina (not quick-cooking)</li>
     <li>5 pounds white or red potatoes, peeled and grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Transfer rack to middle of oven and preheat to 350 F. Coat a 13-by-9-inch pan with cooking spray and set it aside. </li>
      <li>In a large skillet, saut√© bacon and onion until lightly browned and caramelized. Leave in skillet and do not drain fat. Set pan aside to cool.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine eggs, milk, evaporated milk, salt, and farina. Add bacon-onion mixture and drippings. Stir until well combined.</li>
      <li>Using a food processor or by hand, finely grate potatoes, squeezing out excess moisture. Work quickly so potatoes don't darken. While they are still fine to eat if darkened, the final product won't look as appealing.</li>
      <li>Add grated and squeezed potatoes to bacon-egg mixture, combining well.
      <li>Pour potato mixture into prepared pan and bake for 1 1/2 hours or until top is quite brown and interior is solid, but still moist.
      <li>Remove pan from oven and let sit for 5 minutes before cutting into squares.
      <li>Serve as a side dish or as a main course with a salad.
    </ol>
    <p>Cover and refrigerate any leftovers. You can enjoy leftover kugelis by heating portions in the microwave or browning them in butter. Enjoy!</p>
